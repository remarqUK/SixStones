    "prompt": " bright, crystalline chime with a gentle musical sparkle, lasting 0.1 seconds. Starts with a soft, pleasant 'tink' that blossoms into a warm, harmonious bell tone with subtle magical shimmer. Mid-to-high frequency range with a quick, natural decay. Clean and clear like glass touching crystal, but rounded and organic to avoid harshness. Should feel rewarding yet understated - satisfying without being intrusive.",
