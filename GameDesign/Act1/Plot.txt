## **Act 1: The Molten Deep - Six Floors of Descent**

### **Floor 1: The Silent Gatehouse**
*"The Last Day of Commerce"*

The entrance to Khaz Dromar still smells of normalcy gone wrong. The great lift descends past guard stations where half-eaten sandwiches grow mold, where dice sit mid-game, where the last duty roster shows names that no one will ever check off again. 

**Enemies:** 
- **Gem Goblins** - Scavengers that moved in after the dwarves left, now twisted by proximity to the stone's influence
- **Cave Bats** - Their sonar broken, showing you glimpses of spaces between spaces

**Environmental Clues:**
The first warning is carved into the lift shaft at eye level: "DAY 1 - FORGEMASTER FOUND SOMETHING." Below it, in different handwriting: "DAY 3 - HE WON'T LET US LEAVE." Below that, in what looks like fingernail scratches: "DAY 7 - THE STONE SINGS AND WE DANCE."

You find a guard's journal: *"Merchants keep arriving but none leave. The Forgemaster says we're protecting them. From what? The gates are barred from inside. Are we keeping something out, or keeping ourselves in?"*

**Key Discovery:** A child's drawing of the six stones, but the Strength stone is depicted as an eye, watching.

### **Floor 2: The Market Warrens**
*"Commerce of the Damned"*

The merchant quarter tells a story of gradual madness. The early stalls are simply abandoned. The deeper ones show signs of violence—not combat, but self-harm. Merchants who clawed at their own faces. Who wrote messages in their own blood. Who built shrines to something that hurt to perceive.

**Enemies:**
- **Mining Automatons** - The dwarves' mechanical servants, still following corrupted orders
- **Dust Mephits** - Formed from the ashes of burned ledgers that calculated impossible numbers

**Environmental Storytelling:**
Coin presses that printed currency with Grimm's face instead of the king's. Price tags that list costs in "whispers," "memories," and "angles of perception." A butcher's shop where all the meat has been arranged into a perfect spiral that makes your vision blur.

A merchant's final log: *"Day 12. The Forgemaster's economy makes sense now. We're not trading gold. We're trading time. Every transaction takes us further from the present, closer to the event that hasn't happened yet. I've sold my future for a glimpse of the truth. It has too many eyes."*

**Key Discovery:** A map showing the mine's layout—but it's wrong. It shows seven levels, not six. The seventh is labeled only with a symbol that makes your nose bleed when you look at it too long.

### **Floor 3: The Residential Deeps**
*"Where Families Became Fuel"*

The homes tell stories of normalcy twisted into nightmare. Children's bedrooms where all the toys face the walls. Kitchens where every knife points toward the mine shaft. Family portraits where the faces have been replaced with drawings of the Strength stone—except each drawing shows it differently, as if it has multiple forms.

**Enemies:**
- **Fire Beetles** - Pets mutated by forge heat, spelling "HELP" in their swarming patterns
- **Corrupted Moles** - Digging in impossible directions, sometimes emerging inside-out

**Found Horror:**
A nursery rhyme painted on a wall:
*"Six stones bright and six stones fair,
One in mountain, one in air,
When the six become the one,
The door opens and we're done."*

Below it, in a child's handwriting: "Daddy says the door is already open, just very very small. The stone makes it bigger."

**Environmental Puzzle:** 
A family's apartment where everything is normal except all shadows point toward the center of the room, where there's a hole that goes down further than your torch can illuminate. If you drop something in, you never hear it land.

**Key Discovery:** A family tree showing that every dwarf in Khaz Dromar is related if you go back far enough—to a single ancestor named "Aldric Stonefather." But that's impossible. Aldric is human. Isn't he?

### **Floor 4: The Craft Halls**
*"Where Metal Learned to Scream"*

The workshops and guild halls where master smiths practiced their art. Now the art practices itself. Hammers swing at empty anvils in perfect rhythm. Forges burn without fuel, their flames cold and wrong-colored. The sound of metalworking continues, but the metal being worked isn't here—it's somewhere else, being shaped into things that shouldn't exist.

**Enemies:**
- **Forge Golems** - Master smiths who replaced their flesh piece by piece until nothing remained but purpose
- **Magma Elementals** - Summoned from depths that aren't below but beside

**The Smith's Revelation:**
A master smith's workspace, where he documented his transformation:
- Day 1: "The stone improves my craft. Every strike is perfect."
- Day 5: "I don't need to eat. The stone feeds me frequencies."
- Day 10: "Replaced my hammer arm with a better one. Why did I ever tolerate flesh?"
- Day 15: "I understand now. We're not making weapons. We're making keys. Keys for doors that should never open."
- Day 20: [The rest is written in a language that uses angles instead of letters]

**Environmental Hazard:** The forge smoke doesn't rise—it falls, pooling in corners where it whispers in languages that were never meant for tongues to speak.

**Key Discovery:** Blueprints for something called "The Crown's True Configuration"—showing the six stones not arranged in a crown, but as points of a binding circle. In the center, something is drawn but furiously scratched out. The scratches spell "IT MUST NOT BE NAMED."

### **Floor 5: The Old Mines**
*"The Anticipation Gallery"*

The original mine shafts, before they found the stone. Here, prophetic madness preceded discovery. The walls are covered in predictions, warnings, and pleas—all written before the stone was found, as if its influence reached backwards through time.

**Enemies:**
- **Stone Trolls** - Regenerating guardians who forgot what they're guarding
- **Molten Ooze** - The liquified remains of those who touched the stone directly
- **Dwarven Wraiths** - Ghosts who refuse to leave until someone "fixes the count"

**Temporal Distortion:**
Journals here are dated wrong:
- "Tomorrow: We'll find it today"
- "Yesterday: The future stone speaks of the past"
- "Now: Everything happens at once"

A recurring phrase appears everywhere: "THE COUNT IS WRONG. THERE AREN'T SIX. THERE NEVER WERE SIX."

**The Prophet's Chamber:**
You find a sealed room with a skeleton clutching a letter addressed to you—by name. It reads: *"When you read this, I'll have been dead for five years. The stone told me you'd come. It knows your name because Aldric whispered it to the first stone before the mountains were born. You're not the first to gather them. Every age, someone gathers them. Every age, the seal weakens. This time, it breaks. The Lich King tried to change the pattern, but patterns that old have momentum. You can't stop what you are. But you can choose what you become. The stone you're about to claim—listen to what it doesn't say."*

**Key Discovery:** A mining chart showing the six stone locations forming a perfect ritual circle around the kingdom—with the monastery where you were raised at the exact center.

### **Floor 6: The Forge Cathedral**
*"Where Iron Dreams and Nightmares Smith Reality"*

The final floor opens into an impossible space. The cathedral is larger than the mountain that contains it. Gravity works in multiple directions. Streams of molten metal flow upward, freezing into sculptures of things that will happen tomorrow, happened yesterday, are happening never.

**Pre-Boss Encounters:**
- **Ore Worms** - Eating tunnels through spacetime itself
- **The King's Champion** (Proto-version) - A dwarf who volunteered to become Grimm's guardian, now more weapon than person

**The Approach:**
The path to Grimm is lined with his work—weapons that kill concepts, armor that protects from ideas, shields that block perception itself. Each piece whispers its purpose:
- "To cut the threads that bind"
- "To guard against the song of opening"  
- "To strike the watchers between"

**The Forgemaster's Arena:**
Grimm works at the heart of it all, at an anvil made from compressed possibility. He's making keys—thousands of them, each unique, each wrong, each an attempt to lock something that's already opening.

### **BOSS: The Molten Forgemaster**

**Phase Mechanics Tied to Floor Progression:**

**Phase 1** - He fights while working, never stopping his smithing. Each hammer blow reshapes the arena.

**Phase 2** - He begins using the weapons he's made—but they're not weapons, they're crystallized concepts. A sword of Forgetting. A hammer of Unmaking. A shield of Wasn't.

**Phase 3** - The Strength stone fully awakens. Grimm becomes the forge itself. You're fighting inside him, inside the concept of creation corrupted.

**Death Revelation:**
As Grimm dies, his last words echo through all six floors simultaneously, heard by every surviving creature in the mine:

*"We were six who volunteered... one for each stone... but there was a seventh... Aldric volunteered too... for the stone that doesn't exist yet... the one that forms when six unite... the Null Stone... the Opening Key... he's been waiting so long... longer than the world... he's not your mentor... he's the door itself..."*

The mine begins collapsing through dimensions—not just falling, but ceasing. As you flee upward through all six floors, each one reveals a final secret:
- Floor 6: Collapses into mathematical impossibility
- Floor 5: The prophetic writings all change to show your face
- Floor 4: The forges all produce the same item—a crown with seven stones
- Floor 3: Every family portrait now shows Aldric standing behind them
- Floor 2: The coins all land heads-up, showing Aldric's face on every currency
- Floor 1: The guard roster now lists six names—the six guardians. The seventh name is scratched out so violently the paper is destroyed

You emerge to find Aldric waiting, and he speaks words that chill you:

"Six floors down, one stone found. Five more to go until the count is complete. Oh, did Grimm mention there were seven? Poor thing. The heat made him delirious. There are only six. There have only ever been six. Trust me."

His shadow has seven fingers.
