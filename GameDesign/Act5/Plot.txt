## **Act 5: The Temple - Six Floors of Drowned Wisdom**

### **Floor 1: The Pilgrim's Wharf**
*"Where Faith Comes to Drown"*

The temple rises from Lake Sorrow like a broken tooth. Once, pilgrims came here to receive prophecies. Now the dock is littered with abandoned boats, each containing a skeleton still kneeling in prayer position, facing the temple. The water is perfectly clear but wrong—you can see too deep, past where light should reach, into spaces that shouldn't exist beneath a lake.

**Enemies:**
- **Drowned Pilgrims** - Still walking their pilgrimage path underwater, emerging to grab others
- **Holy Wisps** - Souls that came seeking peace, now spreading their unrest

**Environmental Revelation:**
The water reflects not what is, but what will be. Your reflection shows you older, exhausted, placing the fifth stone into a crown. But behind your reflection stands another you, younger, trying to stop yourself. And behind that, another, older still, weeping. The recursion continues infinitely—all you, all at different stages of the same realization.

**The Faithful's Testimonies:**
Carved into the dock posts by pilgrims:
- "Came seeking tomorrow. The Oracle showed me yesterday's tomorrow, which isn't today."
- "She speaks in the past tense about the future. Everything has already failed to happen."
- "The Oracle weeps before you ask your question. She answers before you arrive."
- "I asked about my death. She said 'Which one?'"

**The Donation Box:**
Still accepting offerings. Filled with coins from empires that haven't risen yet, pictures of children not yet born, wedding rings from marriages that will fail. Your mother's locket is at the bottom—the one she was wearing when she died. But she's still wearing it in your memory. Both are true.

**Found Prayer Journal:**
*"Day 1: The Oracle's tears flood the temple. Holy water, they said.*
*Day 3: The tears taste of salt and time. When they touch your lips, you speak prophecies.*
*Day 7: I understand now. She doesn't cry because she's sad. She cries because tears are how we expel what we can't hold. She's expelling futures. Every tear is a path not taken, drowning the path that is.*
*Day 10: I drank the tears. I saw myself writing this. I saw myself not writing this. Both happened. Neither happened. I am. I'm not. The Oracle nods at my understanding, then shakes her head at my ignorance. Both. Neither. Always."*

**Key Discovery:** A mosaic beneath the water showing the temple's construction. But it's being built from the top down, and the builders are working backward, undoing their work as they do it. At the bottom/top, a figure that might be Aldric is unplacing the foundation stone. The stone has seven sides but only six exist.

### **Floor 2: The Ablution Chambers**
*"Where Purity Became Pollution"*

The ritual washing chambers where pilgrims once cleansed themselves before approaching the Oracle. Now the pools are filled with water that cleans too well—it washes away everything, including the concept of being dirty, the memory of being clean, the distinction between the two.

**Enemies:**
- **Fallen Acolytes** - Priests who washed themselves away, only their duties remain
- **Temple Gargoyles** - Waterspouts animated by the weight of confessions they've heard
- **Sacred Golems** - Built from compressed prayers, attacking with the desperation of the faithful

**The Confession Pools:**
Each pool reflects different truths:
- Pool of Past Sins: Shows you killing the guardians, but you're wearing Aldric's face
- Pool of Present Sins: Shows you gathering the stones while your shadow commits atrocities
- Pool of Future Sins: Shows you wearing the crown, unmaking existence with a thought
- Pool of Eternal Sins: Shows nothing—sin requires existence
- Pool of Original Sin: Shows Aldric creating you from nothing, for nothing, to return to nothing

**The Purification Engine:**
A mechanism that was meant to cleanse spiritual impurities. Now it's running in reverse, creating impurities from purity. It produces:
- Water that makes you thirstier
- Soap that spreads dirt
- Towels that wet what they dry
- Prayers that curse what they bless
- Blessings that curse what they pray for

**Priest's Diary:**
*"The Oracle told us to reverse the purification. 'Make them dirty enough to see clearly,' she said. We thought it was madness. Now I understand. Purity is blindness. The clean can't see the filth that cleaning creates. Every washed sin leaves a stain somewhere else. Aldric taught us this. Aldric IS this. He's the stain left by washing away stains."*

**The Baptismal Font:**
Filled with water that baptizes you into different faiths simultaneously. Touching it gives you memories of believing everything:
- You remember worshipping the sun (it goes out)
- You remember worshipping the void (it fills)
- You remember worshipping Aldric (he was never there)
- You remember worshipping yourself (you don't exist)
- You remember worshipping the truth (it lies)

**Key Discovery:** A hidden room where priests tried to map the Oracle's prophecies. The map shows all possible futures branching from now. Every branch ends at the same point—a moment labeled "The Seventh Stone Manifests." But the branches don't stop there. They continue backward, showing that the ending causes the beginning.

---

### **Floor 3: The Gallery of Martyrs**
*"Where Sacrifice Became Sarcasm"*

A long hall lined with statues of religious martyrs. But the water damage has revealed the truth—inside each statue is a living person, frozen in stone, still aware. Their eyes follow you. Their stone lips move slightly, trying to warn or curse or pray. The plaques describing their martyrdom keep changing, showing different deaths, all true.

**Enemies:**
- **Corrupted Seraphs** - Four-winged angels whose extra wings grow from their eyes
- **False Prophets** - Speaking truths that become lies, lies that become truths
- **Heretic Inquisitors** - Hunting heresy by creating it, finding guilt by instilling it

**The Martyrdom Machine:**
A device that creates martyrs retroactively. It shows your name in queue. Date of martyrdom: "Already happened, will happen, is happening, never happened, all of the above." Cause: "Saving the world by ending it."

**The Saint's Testimonies:**
Each statue whispers when you pass:
- St. Erasmus: "I died for truth. Truth died for nothing. Nothing is Aldric's middle name."
- St. Catherine: "The wheel broke me. I broke the wheel. We're all spokes. Aldric is the hub."
- St. Sebastian: "Arrows of faith pierced me. Faith in what? In faith itself. Recursive belief. Aldric believes in us believing in him."
- St. Perpetua: "I recorded my martyrdom. But I wrote it before it happened. Effect preceded cause. Like you gathering stones."

**The Miracle Archive:**
Documents of divine interventions, but each one shows the miracle was actually making things worse:
- Healing the sick (they lived to suffer more)
- Feeding the hungry (they hungered for more than food)
- Raising the dead (they brought something back with them)
- Answering prayers (the answers were questions)

**The Oracle's Early Prophecies:**
From before her transformation:
*"A child will gather six stones. The child is everyone. The stones are one stone seen from six angles. The gathering is scattering. The child is no one. The stones don't exist. The gathering already happened. The child is Aldric. The stones are Aldric. The gathering is Aldric. Aldric is [SCRATCHED OUT VIOLENTLY]"*

**Key Discovery:** Your martyrdom statue, already here, already aged. The plaque reads: "Saint [Your Name], who saved existence by betraying it. Gathered six stones to prevent the seventh. Failed successfully. Died living. Lived dying. Is reading this plaque right now." The statue's face is peaceful. Its stone eyes are weeping. The tears are real.

### **Floor 4: The Theology Library**
*"Where Sacred Texts Argue With Themselves"*

A flooded library of religious texts from every faith, all simultaneously true and false. The water has made the ink run, and the words from different books are mixing, creating new blasphemous truths. Books float past, their pages turning themselves, reading their readers.

**Enemies:**
- **Depth Lurkers** - Tentacled things that pull you into theological debates that have no resolution
- **Angelic Wardens** - Still guarding knowledge that should be forbidden, not knowing they've become what they guard against
- **Avatar of Doubt** - Making you question not just faith, but the existence of questions

**The Concordance of Contradiction:**
A massive book that reconciles all religious texts by proving they're all wrong in the exact same way. The central thesis: "All gods are masks worn by the absence of god. Aldric collects masks."

**Swimming Through Scripture:**
The flooded passages between shelves contain:
- The Gospel of Aldric (every page is blank but weighs tons)
- The Unnamed Sutra (reading it unnamed you)
- The Crown's Testament (Was it "Crown" or "Crow"? The letters shift)
- The Vedas of Void (mathematical proofs that nothing equals everything)
- The Tao of Taking (the path that leads to pathlessness)

**The Heresy Section:**
Every book here was declared heretical, but they're all accurate:
- "The Seven Stones of Creation" (describes a seventh stone that unmakes the six)
- "The True History of the Crown" (it was never broken, breaking it created it)
- "Aldric: A Biography" (every chapter is about a different person, all named Aldric, all the same)
- "Your Life Is A Lie" (it's your actual biography, but everything is slightly wrong)

**The Reading Room Flood:**
The water here contains dissolved knowledge. Breathing it makes you know things:
- The Oracle didn't go mad from seeing the future; the future went mad from being seen
- Every guardian volunteered, but volunteering was choreographed by prophecy
- You're not the first to gather six stones; you're the first to be the last
- Aldric isn't immortal; he exists outside of mortality as a concept

**The Book of Common Prayer (Revised):**
All prayers now end with: "But we know you're not listening, because listening would mean you exist, and existence is the problem we're praying about."

**Key Discovery:** A book titled "The Joke." Opening it reveals it's hollow, containing a mirror. In the mirror, you see the Oracle, young and uncorrupted, writing the book you're holding. She writes: "The wisdom stone doesn't grant wisdom. It grants the wisdom to know that wisdom is ignorance that's given up. I volunteer to give up. Someone has to hold the stone that knows why the stones shouldn't be held. Let me be the joke everyone's in on but no one gets."

### **Floor 5: The Sanctuary of Sacraments**
*"Where Holy Becomes Hole-y"*

The main worship chamber, now half-submerged. The altar floats. The pews are arranged in impossible geometries—some on walls, some on the ceiling, all somehow still facing the wrong direction. The stained glass windows show scenes that change based on what you believe, but they all end the same way—with everything ending.

**Enemies:**
- **Leviathan Spawn** - Lesser sea monsters that shouldn't exist in a lake, swimming through air and water alike
- **Divine Paradoxes** - Living contradictions that damage reality by existing
- **The Congregation** - Faithful ghosts still attending a service that never ends, never began

**The Eternal Service:**
A ghostly congregation perpetually attending mass. The priest speaks backward from the future. The congregation responds forward from the past. They never sync up. The hymn they're singing has notes that don't exist. You recognize the melody—Aldric used to hum it.

**The Altar of Sacrifice:**
Every sacrifice ever offered here is still happening. You see:
- Lambs being slaughtered that bleat prophecies
- Grain being burned that grows as it burns
- Wine being poured that ferments into blood, then back to grapes, then to soil
- Your childhood innocence, offered by Aldric, still bleeding

**The Baptismal Record:**
Every person baptized here is listed. Your name appears seven times:
1. Baptized into life (by your mother)
2. Baptized into death (by the Lich King)
3. Baptized into purpose (by Aldric)
4. Baptized into doubt (by yourself)
5. Baptized into understanding (by the Oracle)
6. Baptized into ignorance (by the crown)
7. Baptized into [THE ENTRY IS YOUR DEATH CERTIFICATE]

**The Confession Booth:**
Still operational. You hear confessions from all times:
- Past: "Forgive me Father, I'm going to destroy the world"
- Present: "Forgive me Father, I'm destroying the world"
- Future: "Forgive me Father, I destroyed the world"
- Outside Time: "Forgive me Father, I am the world destroying itself"
- The Priest's Response: "I forgive you, my child. Aldric forgives you. You can't forgive yourself because yourself is the sin."

**The Sacred Geometry:**
The sanctuary's architecture contains a mathematical proof. Following it with your eyes proves that:
1. If God is omnipotent, God can create a stone too heavy to lift
2. If God can't lift it, God isn't omnipotent
3. Therefore, God can't exist as described
4. But if God doesn't exist, who's creating the paradox?
5. The paradox is God
6. Aldric is the paradox
7. You're enabling Aldric
8. Therefore, you're creating God by destroying God

**Key Discovery:** Behind the altar, hidden by water, is a mosaic showing the true cosmology. Six stones orbiting a seventh void. The void isn't empty—it's full of emptiness. It has a face. The face is everyone who's ever gathered the stones. The face is currently becoming yours.

### **Floor 6: The Oracle's Drowning Chamber**
*"Where Future Comes to Die in the Past"*

The Oracle's inner sanctum, completely flooded, but you can breathe the water—it's made of liquified time. Swimming through it, you experience past and future simultaneously. The Oracle floats in the center, her transformation into something beyond human nearly complete.

**Pre-Boss Encounters:**
- **Temporal Echoes** - Past and future versions of yourself, trying to warn you, fighting to stop you
- **The Oracle's Regrets** - Physical manifestations of futures she couldn't prevent

**The Oracle's Transformation:**
You can see her throughout time:
- Past: Young, hopeful, volunteering to guard the Wisdom stone
- Recent Past: Realizing what the stone really shows
- Present: Tentacled, weeping, prophesying
- Near Future: Dying by your hand
- Far Future: Grateful for death
- Outside Time: Never existed, always existed

### **BOSS: The Drowned Oracle**

The arena is her tears made manifest—an ocean of sorrow for futures that will be, were, and never were. She floats in a sphere of holy water, tentacles of crystallized prophecy extending into all possible timelines.

**The Oracle Speaks:**
Her voice is the echo of echoes, speaking from when:

*"You've come. You came. You'll come. You never left. Welcome to the drowning of wisdom, where knowing goes to forget itself.*

*I see you, [Your Name]. I see all your names. You were Marcus who failed. You were Sarah who succeeded too well. You were Chen who chose differently but arrived here anyway. You're everyone who's ever gathered six stones because gathering them is what creates you backward through time.*

*I volunteered for the Wisdom stone thinking I'd guide the future. But the stone doesn't grant foresight—it grants hindsight into futures that haven't happened yet. I see how it ends. I see how it always ends. The same. Different. Both. Neither.*

*Do you want to know the truth? The terrible, hilarious truth? The stones aren't the lock. The stones aren't the key. The stones are the door. And the door only exists when you try to close it. Aldric isn't opening anything—he's holding it open by making us try to close it.*

*Look at me. LOOK AT WHAT WISDOM BECOMES. I have eyes in timelines that shouldn't exist. I have tentacles reaching into possibilities that can't be. I weep the tears of unborn gods. And I know—I KNOW—that killing me is saving me is dooming me is freeing me is nothing is everything is exactly what was always going to happen!"*

**Boss Phases:**

**Phase 1: "The Seer of Sorrow"** (110 HP)
- Shows you false futures where you win (you don't)
- Floods the arena with tears that age you rapidly
- Summons past/future versions of herself to help

*"I see your mother! She's alive in timeline 7B! But you killed her in timeline 3A by being born! Both true! Neither true! The wisdom is knowing that knowing doesn't help!"*

**Phase 2: "The Depths of Understanding"** (85 HP)
- Arena becomes underwater, but water is made of liquified prophecies
- Tentacles drag you through visions of your failures across all timelines
- Your own future ghosts attack you

*"Want to know when you die? Trick question! You already did! You will! You are right now! Death is just birth running backward! Aldric taught me that! Aldric teaches everyone that BY EXISTING AT THEM!"*

**Phase 3: "The Crown of Drowning"** (60 HP)
- The Wisdom stone creates a crown of water above her head
- Every attack shows you the consequences across time
- She begs you to kill her while healing herself

*"The fifth stone! Take it! Take it and near your completion! Your gathered relics of ruin! Your assembled keys of catastrophe! One more and the crown hungers for the seventh! The Wisdom stone will show you what I see—that seeing is the problem! Every observation collapses possibility into tragedy! Stop looking! STOP LOOKING! But you can't because looking is what you are!"*

**The Oracle's Death Vision:**

As she dies, she shares her final prophecy, forcing you to see what she sees:

*You see yourself placing the fifth stone in the crown. Only one more remains—the Charisma stone held by the Lich King. But already the crown begins reshaping itself, preparing space for a seventh stone that materializes from the absence—a stone made of crystallized void, of materialized nothing, of present absence.*

*You see Aldric revealing his true form—not a person but a process, not a being but a between, the gap between cause and effect given consciousness and purpose.*

*You see the Lich King's truth—he was the previous you, the last person to gather six stones, who chose to scatter them rather than place the seventh. But scattering them just reset the cycle.*

*You see yourself becoming the next Lich King, scattering the stones, waiting for the next you to gather them.*

*But then you see something else—a choice the Oracle kept hidden. A way to break the cycle. It requires...*

She dies before showing you, her last words: *"The basement... your childhood room... what Aldric buried beneath your bed... it's not the seventh stone... it's the eighth... the one that prevents seven... but using it means... means... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... the wisdom is knowing that some choices are so horrible that making them is better than not making them..."*

### **The Temple's Collapse**

As the Oracle dies, her tears stop holding the temple together:

**Floor 6**: The water turns to actual water, drowning everything
**Floor 5**: The sanctuary inverts, inside becomes outside
**Floor 4**: All books write their final words: "ALDRIC WINS REGARDLESS"
**Floor 3**: The martyrs' statues crumble, freeing ancient warnings
**Floor 2**: The pools overflow, washing away the distinction between sacred and profane
**Floor 1**: The dock extends infinitely, but all paths lead to Aldric

You emerge, gasping, holding the Wisdom stone. It immediately shows you everything the Oracle saw. You understand now why she wept constantly. Every future you see ends the same way—with you placing six stones together, making room for the seventh.

Except...

One timeline flickers differently. In it, you don't go to the castle next. You return to the monastery. To the basement. To what's under your childhood bed. To the eighth stone that shouldn't exist—the stone of Rejection, of Refusing, of No.

But in that timeline, Aldric is already there, waiting, smiling.

"Five stones now," he says in the present, but you hear him across all timelines. "Only the Lich King's Charisma stone remains. The circle nearly closes. Opens. Both. The Lich King is preparing for your arrival. He's practiced dying for twenty years. He's gotten quite good at it. But don't worry—death is just another doorway in this labyrinth of souls."

He offers you a handkerchief for the Oracle's tears on your face. It's dry but somehow makes you wetter.

"Oh," he adds, as if remembering something trivial, "don't believe what she showed you about the basement. There's nothing there. There was never anything there. The eighth stone is just the seven stone miscounted. Trust me."

But his shadow, as always, falls in seven directions.

And one of those directions points toward home.
