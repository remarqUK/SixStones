### **üîÆ FINAL BOSS: The Drowned Oracle**

**The Oracle has become a terrifying fusion of prophet and sea creature through the WIS stone:**

She floats in a sphere of holy water, her lower body transformed into tentacles. Her eyes weep constantly, seeing all futures simultaneously. The WIS stone has replaced her third eye, glowing with terrible knowledge.

- Divine light: Blinds you (gems hidden for 1 turn)
- Summons 2 Fallen Acolytes

**Phase 2: "The Depths" (85 HP)**
- Floods the board edges with holy water
- Tentacles grab and drown gems (destroyed)
- Healing rain (heals herself 8 HP per turn)
- Your WIS gems heal her instead of you

**Phase 3: "The Truth" (60 HP)**
- WIS stone cracks, showing terrible visions
- Time fractures (your moves happen in random order)
- Divine wrath (all non-WIS gems become cursed)
- BUT: WIS gems now do 5x damage to her

**Visual Design:**
- Upper body of elderly woman in robes
- Lower body is mass of tentacles
- WIS stone as third eye in forehead
- Constantly weeping prophet tears
- Floating in sphere of water
- Barnacles growing on tentacles
- Holy symbols twisted into eldrich shapes

**Death Quote:**
*"Finally... I see clearly... forgive me... faithful ones..."*
