### **üóø FINAL BOSS: The Eternal Basilisk**

**An ancient basilisk that has absorbed the CON stone into its third eye:**

This 30-foot serpentine monster has lived for millennia. Its scales are covered in stone dust, its eight legs end in crystal claws, and the CON stone burns orange in its forehead, granting it impossible endurance.

**Boss Phases:**

**Phase 1: "The Hunter" (120 HP)**
- Petrifying gaze (random gems turn to stone)
- Dust breath (exhausts 3x3 sections)
- Regenerates 5 HP per turn

**Phase 2: "The Ancient" (90 HP)**
- Sheds skin (removes all debuffs, full heal once)
- Summons 2 Cave Crawlers
- Venom pools appear (damages adjacent gems)

**Phase 3: "The Stone's Power" (60 HP)**
- CON stone blazes with power
- Hyper regeneration (10 HP per turn)
- BUT: Matching CON gems does 5x damage
- Desperation: Tries to collapse the cave ceiling

**Visual Design:**
- Eight legs like a true basilisk
- Scales crusted with limestone
- CON stone as third eye
- Dust constantly falling from body
- Ancient beyond measure
- Blind white eyes (except stone eye)
- Fangs dripping with venom

**Death Quote:**
*"I... who have lived... ten thousand years... finally... rest..."*

### **üõ°Ô∏è CON Theme Mechanics**

Each enemy tests endurance differently:
- **Exhaustion** (reduced gem effectiveness)
- **Degeneration** (ongoing damage)
- **Resource denial** (can't heal properly)
- **Attrition** (long battles)
- **Regeneration races** (they heal, you must outdamage)
- **Poison/Petrification** (status effects to endure)

---

### **üìä Difficulty Scaling**

This act is notably harder because:
- Enemies have more HP (testing endurance)
- More regeneration/healing enemies
- Status effects last longer
- Less healing available from environment
- Battles are wars of attrition

Players must manage resources carefully and value CON gems highly to survive the dusty caves!
