### **üéØ DEX Theme Mechanics**

Each enemy emphasizes speed/agility challenges:
- Turn stealing (you're too slow)
- Dodge phases (can't hit them)
- Board manipulation (trickery)
- Trap setting (test your awareness)
- Speed battles (they act more often)

This makes players value their DEX gems more and consider builds that increase their speed/initiative!
