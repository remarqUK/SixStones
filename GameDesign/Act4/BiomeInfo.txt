### **ðŸŽ“ FINAL BOSS: The Transcendent Magus**

**Cornelius has merged with pure magical energy through the INT stone:**

He floats in a constellation of orbiting books, crystals, and equations. His body phases between solid, energy, and geometric patterns. The INT stone replaces his head like a giant glowing brain.

**Boss Phases:**

**Phase 1: "The Scholar" (100 HP)**
- Transmutation spell (changes all gems of one color)
- Summons 2 Animated Spellbooks
- Shield that only magic (INT) gems can break

**Phase 2: "The Equation" (80 HP)**
- Board becomes puzzle (must match in specific order)
- Time magic (reverses your last move)
- Counterspell (cancels your 4+ matches)

**Phase 3: "Pure Intellect" (60 HP)**
- INT stone goes critical
- Polymorph (turns random gems into animals/objects)
- Mind break (all gems look the same for 2 turns)
- HOWEVER: Vulnerable to non-magic damage (STR/DEX do 3x)

**Visual Design:**
- No longer fully human
- Body made of floating geometric shapes
- INT stone as crystalline brain
- Books orbiting constantly
- Speaks in equations and formulas
- Reality warps around him
- Runes and numbers floating in air

**Death Quote:**
*"Impossible... I calculated... every... variable..."*
